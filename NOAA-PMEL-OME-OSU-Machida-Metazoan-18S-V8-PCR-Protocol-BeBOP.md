## BACKGROUND

### Summary

This protocol is for amplifying the Small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) 18S v8 gene in eukaryotes. The primers (forward: Machida 18S #3 F, reverse: Machida 18S #5 R) were first presented in [Machida & Nowlton 2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046180). The target amplicon size is ~380 base pairs.

This primer set targets metazoan organisms (e.g., molluscs, arthropods, and vertebrates). Important note, this primer also amplifies non-target organisms including single-celled phytoplankton (e.g., dinoflagellates, diatoms, and haptophytes).

The protocol presented here is intended as the first PCR of a two-step PCR next generation sequencing library preparation using Illumina Nextera Unique Dual Indices. Our written protocol does not include the second PCR step in which unique library-specific barcodes are attached to each round 1 PCR product. 

### Method Description and Rationale

This protocol was chosen because it has been used by the Arctic Marine Biodiveristy Observation Netowrk (AMBON) as well as MBON, a leader in the field of eDNA research and an important partner in the Arctic/Alaska region, to generate marine eDNA time series. Our protocol uses the same polymerase, and thermocycling conditions as MBARI and MBON 16S v4 protocol, but is only 25 µL in total reaction volume. We intentionally chose this protocol to promote standardization of ocean biomolecular observations and easily facilitate integration of PMEL OME eDNA data with AMBON eDNA time series.

This amplification protocol is accessible to most molecular biology labs.

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

This protocol has been used to amplify extracted DNA from thousands of filtered sea water samples taken from coastal stations off the western coast of North America in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean (primarily off California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska). Samples collected range in depth from surface ocean (epipelagic biome) to just off bottom (benthic biome) at varying distances from shore (coastal to off-shelf).

### Personnel Required

One person with molecular biology experience.

### Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions including wearing PPE should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to chemical reagents.

### Training Requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and programming and running PCR thermocyclers) is required to conduct this protocol.

### Time Needed to Execute the Procedure

PCR preparation and running the PCR protocol for a single 96-well plate takes 3.5 hours (210 minutes), 120 mins of which is the thermocycler run time. Additional plates can be run simultaneously without greatly increasing the time required.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Protocol

#### Preparation

1. Sterilize workspaces and durable equipment, including pipettes within the BSC with 10% bleach. Then wipe down all surfaces and equipment with 70% EtOH.
2. If you have a UV crosslinker available, UV pipettes and tube racks regularly for 2 minutes. 
3. Run the UV light in the BSC for 30 minutes before starting work.
4. Label all PCR plates both on the side of the plate and on the top of the foil (in the plate margins). Recommended labeling scheme includes plate name, primer, date of PCR, and personnel initials.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

*Note: When possible, PCR set-up should be carried out in a separate pre-PCR space that is distinct from where the post-PCR space where thermocyclers are located and all post-PCR processing is performed. No equipment, consumables, or reagents should be shared between pre- and post-PCR spaces with a unidirectional flow of sample processing.*

1. Set out primers and positive control to thaw.
2. Vortex and spin down thawed positive control, primers, and nuclease free water. Then tap/flick AmpliTaq rather than vortexing before spinning down. Thawed reagents should be stored in a cooling block or fridge when not in use.
3. Pool reagents to make final master mix, as denoted in above in reagent mixture table.
4. Set out template DNA to thaw if frozen.
5. Aliquot 22.5 μL of final master mix into each well of the PCR plate. The plate should sit in a cold block to ensure the reagents remain at a low temperature.
6. Add 2.5 μL DNA template to each well. If input gDNA was > 10ng/µL, it was diluted to 1:3. (See [Machida Metazoan 18S V8 PCR Protocol Sheet Draft](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14exlweJkmsPSTahdmubbECPgm2iUhXlben1yksLek1Y/edit#gid=1701210116)), but reserve two wells for the positive control and a no template control (NTC). 
7. To one well each, add 2.5 μL of the positive control and 2.5 μL of nuclease-free water for the NTC.
8. Seal the PCR plate with foil.
9. Spin down the plate, and then transport in cooler blocks before placing in thermocycler.
10.  Run thermocycler protocol.
11. PCRs were run in triplicate for each sample and then pooled evenly by volume.

### Quality control

1. Plates should be removed from the thermocycler  after the run completes and stored at 4°C until run on a gel. Storing the PCR product at -20˚C is ideal for 1-6 month term storage, while -80˚C is ideal for long-term storage.
2. Run gel visualization to confirm successful PCR. [NOAA-PMEL-OME-GelVisualization-Protocol pending]

#### Positive Control
A positive control is used in every PCR run to verify success of the PCR reaction. 2μL of both Camel and Ferret positive control at 0.5mg/ml were used in place of template DNA. One well per plate per positive control is alotted. 

-[Zyagen Camel Genomic DNA (Cat_No:GC-270)](https://www.zyagen.com/product/camel-genomic-dna/)

-[Zyagen Ferret Genomic DNA (Cat_No:GF-180)](https://www.zyagen.com/product/ferret-genomic-dna/)

#### Negative Control

Nuclease-free water is used as a no template control (NTC) when setting up each PCR plate. One well per plate is alloted to a NTC. NTCs should be run in addition to both field blanks and extraction blanks.

### Basic Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue 1**: Streaking is observed for sample wells in gel but positive control band appears normal. 

**Solution**: Dilute the sample DNA to a 1:10 dilution with nuclease-free water. If smearing is still observed using a 1:10 dilution, dilute the DNA samples further to a 1:100 dilution. If the samples do not amplify under these conditions the sample likely is inhibited or has too little target DNA and thus is unlikely to yield valuable results. Alternative solutions include cleaning DNA extractions with a commercial clean up kit.

**Issue 2**: No bands were observed in the PCR, including the positive control.

**Solution**: The PCR likely failed. Check reagents to confirm they were not mishandled or expired and rerun the PCR. If positive control fails again, reagents or positive control are likely compromised. 

**Issue 3**: Band observed in no template control.

**Solution**: The PCR was likely contaminated. Sterilize lab space thoroughly and rerun with new aliquots of reagents.
